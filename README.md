## Planning

My planning is the following:  
Done?  
[x] - Start the project  
[x] - Styled components  
[x] - Logic building  
[x] - Redux  
[ ] - Finalizing the game  
[ ] - See where I'm at and check on improving the app

## Project Status

Project is: _in progress_  
Next up: Time to do some touch ups and add some UX

## Difficulties

Just finished the logic and Redux part, I've had massive help from Barry Michael Doyle on this.
The logic and Redux part seemed daunting at first. Been learning a lot about the logic and implementing Redux.
